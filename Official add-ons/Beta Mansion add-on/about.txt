This add-on adds a mansion that matched the E3 2001 demo of the game.

This is a separate mansion with separate save-data.
A max health counter will display in the mansion, you'll figure out why it's there when in the "area 2" hallway.
The Poltergust 500 will overheat when you vacuum for too long, keep that in mind.
New money type: Ghost Coin.
New ghost types: Ghost, Puncher, Body Slammer, Basher, Bat, Boo, Shining Ghost, Flying Fish and Mouse.
The hallways, bath room and back yard cannot be cleared.

== Known issues ==

* Beta mansion theme doesn't transition between different health values smoothly.
* Body slammers are missing several sounds.
* Poltergust 500 misses a few sounds.
