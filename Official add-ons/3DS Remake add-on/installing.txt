== NOTICE ==
This is an official add-on, it is made by the map creator and will be updated alongside the map.
Any compatibility issues with this add-on should be reported to the conflicting add-on.

The 11 ghosts by yourself in the training room advancement is not granted for this add-on's training room program. Select vanilla to try to get that instead.

This add-on will force a load order, the first world load with this add-on enabled while others are enabled too may take a while to load due to how this works. (There's nothing I can do to improve this.)

== How to install ==
1. Open the Luigi's Mansion world.
2. Open the "datapacks" folder
3. Drop the data pack folder (named "3DS Remake") in this folder

== Updates ==
When updating the map, delete the existing 3DS Remake add-on and re-install the latest version.

== Latest compatible world version ==
Same version as this folder is shipped with.
