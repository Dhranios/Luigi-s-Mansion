To receive development build updates, pull from https://github.com/Medacorp/Luigi-s-Mansion into the extracted download folder.

Before you pull, you need to disregard all your changes. Doing this without preparation may cause "damage" to your world.
To have no lasting "damage" on your world, follow these steps before disregarding changes:
1. Go to the Underground Lab.
2. Talk to E. Gadd.
3. Select "The Mansion".
4. Wait for E. Gadd to go back inside the lab.
5. Have every player in the world be in the Boo Woods. Being in the lab or mansion may result in some broken behavior.
6. Close the world/server.

# Official add-ons
When making your own, consider supporting these, as players may install them as well.
