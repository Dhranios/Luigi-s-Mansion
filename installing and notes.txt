== NOTICE ==
This map requires 1.19.3.

Bugs should be reported on the github here: https://github.com/Medacorp/Luigi-s-Mansion/issues
Please do look if it's already reported.

Do NOT turn chat off, or you will get stuck. The map requires players to click on certain chat messages to advance. 

== Known issues ==

* A bunch of sounds are missing
** Conservatory instrument music
** Poltergust expelling dust, vacuuming with ball held, exploding
** Blue Twirler/Blue Blaze
** Ceiling Surprise/Purple Bomber
** Elemental Ghost bounce
** Slim Bankshot
** Henry and Orville
** Clockwork Soldiers
** Furniture ambience, changing state
** Ghost Portrificationizer
* Lots of entities in rooms with mirrors cause quite some lag (just grab the money quickly while I try to find ways to reduce the lag)
* Some instances of rapid teleportation may make client-server communication difficult. (Such as being pulled by a ghost)
** When on the ball room floors, if affected, disconnect and let the player with the best connection clear the room, then the floors stop
** https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-197855 was made about this, but Mojang decided not to track this as a bug. A rewrite of the system was planned when Mojang was last asked.
* Sometimes entities don't show rotated correctly (Mainly noticable with Neville)
** If this affects doors, don't worry, you can still use them and go through to the correct side.
** Vote for https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-103800 to get this fixed!

== Supported languages ==
English (US) is the base language of the map, all other languages are worked on via Crowdin. (https://crowdin.com/project/medacorp-projects)
Any issues with other languages' strings should be reported there. You can also go there to help translate the map to more languages.

== How to install ==
1. Launch Minecraft: Java Edition
2. Select "Options..."
3. Select "Resource Packs..."
4. Select "Open Pack folder"
- <A file explorer opens>
5. Drop the resource pack folder (named "Luigi's Mansion Resource Pack") in this folder
6. Go up one folder
7. Go to "saves"
8. Drop the world folder (named "Luigi's Mansion") in this folder
9. Enable the resource pack in the resource packs menu
10. Select to open the world
11. Be patient while it is loading everything; this is a map with a lot of functionality it needs to load in

== How to update ==
The best way to update your current save is as follows:
1. Go to the Underground Lab.
2. Talk to E. Gadd.
3. Select the normal mansion.
4. Wait for E. Gadd to go back inside the lab.
5. Have every player in the world be in the Boo woods. Being in the lab or mansion may result in some broken behavior.
6. Close the world.
7. Drop the updated world onto the old world, overwriting all files it clashes with.
This will replace everything but advancements, player/entity data, statistics, scoreboard and command storage, keeping all progress you have.
If you were affected by a softlock, contact Dhranios on the Medacorp discord: https://discord.gg/Nn6wScEc88

== Installing add-ons ==
Add-ons are downloaded with their installation guides included.
Just make sure that the add-ons you install are compatible with the map version you use (and each other).
Do not rename any add-on file names (nor unzip them if they were zipped), as they may need a specific loading order, and to do this, the file name must not be changed.

== Uninstalling add-ons ==
The best way to uninstall add-ons is as follows:
1. Go to the Underground Lab.
2. Talk to E. Gadd.
3. Select the normal mansion.
4. Wait for E. Gadd to go back inside the lab.
5. Have every player in the world be in the Boo woods. Being in the lab or mansion may result in some broken behavior.
Then close the world or server, and remove the data pack from the world.
1. Go to the "Luigi's Mansion" world folder
2. Go to the "datapacks" folder
3. Delete the desired add-ons. (Do NOT delete the "Luigi's Mansion" folder, as that's the base map behavior.)
