Portrait ghosts always drop 4 small pearls before dropping a medium pearl.

Portrait ghosts drop pearls every health value which ends at a 0, except the max health, and 0 itself.

The last possible small or medium pearl dropped is replaced with a big one if it had not dropped a pearl in any previous suction.

For example if max health = 20, the only pearl will always be big; if max health was 500, the 48th one is big if the first pearl didn't drop in a previous suction.
