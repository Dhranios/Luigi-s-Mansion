Several functions and documents list comments with "todelete" with a note, here's their deletion condition.
* "old mirror reflections" All mirrors have turned into furniture entities.
* "old furniture" All furniture has been changed to furniture entities.
* "room models" All rooms get models; this is just a note, and not guarenteed to happen.
In functions everything below the initial "#todelete" applies to that reason, until the next "#/todelete".
In documents, only the object/field with the "#todelete" applies for that reason.
