bugs:
having a non-ticking non-reset room will make all entities that look at players in said room continue moving forward, rather than vanish (portrait ghosts should vanish too, resetting them, except shivers; vacuumable ghosts should be removed from existence)
toads and e. gadd switching animations often don't reset AnimationProg
ghosts that vanish lose some info (eg color for beta ghosts); fix: do not replace the entity, make them move back down when they vanish; make them invisible with specific armor values; give them the unseen idle animation (rename current idle to haunt); remove ghost marker entity
foyer, main hallway, hallway, attic hallway and basement hallway sections aren't considered separate rooms (no resetting of hallways partially, nor resetting rooms around hallways when traversing one; add "viewpoint" to balcony from master bedroom (vise versa is not needed, as curtains are closed anyways), and from bottom of the well to courtyard, and secret altar (not courtyard to secret altar)(so the lights turn on))
wardrobe room closet ghosts (and the resulting money from the speedy spirit) tend to get stuck in the closet
when boos attack, they don't move to the target's y coordinate, making them miss the player
money spawning on the floor of a room in the hidden mansion doesn't get the room score unless moving up (increase room size by 2 on y and move it 1 down)
elemental ghosts disappear when the room lights up
elemental ghosts can appear multiple times from 1 source, if the prior ones are far away enough

to do:
add room headers for spectators (set room score, but don't tick room)
add functional mirrors (normal done, working on converting hidden mansion to allow this (coordinates left); fix trick door)
add cinema ghost shadow
add missing sounds (@LaserRanger is working on this)
add missing models (portrait ghosts+corresponding objects; biff atlas and after, excluding madame clairvoya, boolossus and king boo (not bowser or portrificationizing king boo))
add portrificationizing ghost/mario animation in the first section of the portrificationizer
add boo idle animation is empty
add king boo magic animation (also make mario turn to bowser)
add ghost, puncher and twirler smug and basher animations
add beta animations for all ghosts (appearing, twirler attack, etc.)
change normal ghost models to leather horse armor (allows separating color for the beta map)
change boolossus to have the boos look up/down (model already rotated if the entity looks up/down, but the entity doesn't change rotation yet except when merging)
change boos to move up/down like boolossus
change boolossus to move up/down more randomly, rather than all in sync, until one attacks, desyncing them
pre-build boss battle "rooms", rather than generate them (also rotate to face same way as mansion)
separate vacuumable ghost (including gold mice) spawning from waves, re-triggering when a player newly enters the room, even it it was non-ticking, non-reset

conditional:
go through both mansions and replace brewing stands and redstone torches with candles; remodel candles (when you can no longer extinguish them by hand in adventure); not if replacing all furniture
use markers, if they are deemed useful

maybe:
replace all furniture with models and barriers (allows for the shaking animation and nuking of all map files)
