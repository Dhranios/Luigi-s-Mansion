bugs:
having a non-ticking non-reset room will make all entities that look at players in said room continue moving forward, rather than go "home" or stop moving
ghosts switching animations often don't reset AnimationProg
ghosts that vanish lose some info (eg color for beta ghosts); fix: do not replace the entity, make them move back down when they vanish; make them invisible with specific armor values; give them the unseen idle animation (rename current idle to haunt); remove ghost marker entity
foyer, main hallway, hallway, attic hallway and basement hallway sections aren't considered separate rooms (no resetting or hallways partially)
locked door animations still uses clone, rather than setblock-ing a new door
wardrobe room closet ghosts (and the resulting money from the speedy spirit) tend to get stuck in the closet
boo warping is broken, they no longer know what room they end up in and what room section they're in
when boos attack, they don't move to the target's y coordinate, making them miss the player
pulling boos with multiple players can result in the boo being pulled into a player leading to massive damage
money spawning on the lowest floor of a room doesn't get the room score unless moving up (increase room size by 2 on y and move it 1 down)

to do:
add functional mirrors (WIP, working on converting normal mansion to allow this (coordinates left))
add cinema ghost shadow
add missing sounds (@LaserRanger is working on this)
add missing models (portrait ghosts+corresponding objects; biff atlas and after, excluding madame clairvoya, boolossus and king boo (not bowser or portrificationizing king boo))
add boo idle animation is missing
add king boo magic animation (also make mario turn to bowser)
add ghost, puncher and twirler smug and basher animations
change boolossus to have the boos look up/down as they move up/down
change boos to move up/down like boolossus
change boolossus to move up/down more randomly, rather than all in sync, until one attacks, desyncing them
pre-build boss battle "rooms", rather than generate them (also rotate to face same way as mansion)

conditional:
go through both mansions and replace brewing stands and redstone torches with candles; remodel candles (when you can no longer extinguish them by hand in adventure); not if replacing all furniture

maybe:
replace all furniture with models and barriers (allows for the shaking animation and nuking of all map files)


3ds add-on:
remove the couple chairs in the tea room
remove the 2 pans in the kitchen
add strobulb flashlight type
add new gallery
add gallery battles
add slightly modified strings (such as uncle grimmly call "prefers rooms with mirrors *and clothes*")
add teleporting of players in luigis_mansion:hidden to luigis_mansion:normal with Z = Z * -1 + 15
